# Study Design - Collecting the data

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. Full description is found at the link below.

# Raw data:

# Code Book - variables
Please note that the complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in 'features.txt'

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

1. tBodyAcc-XYZ
2. tGravityAcc-XYZ
3. tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
4. tBodyGyro-XYZ
5. tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
6. tBodyAccMag
7. tGravityAccMag
8. tBodyAccJerkMag
9. tBodyGyroMag
10. tBodyGyroJerkMag
11. fBodyAcc-XYZ
12. fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
13. fBodyGyro-XYZ
14. fBodyAccMag
15. fBodyAccJerkMag
16. fBodyGyroMag
17. fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:

1. mean(): Mean value
2. std(): Standard deviation
3. mad(): Median absolute deviation 
4. max(): Largest value in array
5. min(): Smallest value in array
6. sma(): Signal magnitude area
7. energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
8. iqr(): Interquartile range 
9. entropy(): Signal entropy
10. arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
11. correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
12. maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
13. meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
14. skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
15. kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
16. bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
17. angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

1. gravityMean
2. tBodyAccMean
3. tBodyAccJerkMean
4. tBodyGyroMean
5. tBodyGyroJerkMean

# Creating the Tidy Data Set
For this tidy data set, we only considered mean and the standard deviation as required by the course project. The tidy data set is also created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
