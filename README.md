# gettingandcleaningdata
This contains my course project for Getting and Cleaning Data in coursera. 

# Objective
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

# Source Data
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

# How to run this code:
1. set your working directory to the UCI HAR Dataset folder 
2. "run_analysis.R" should also be in your new working folder
3. use source("run_analysis.R") 
4. An output file with the name "tidy_data.txt" with data similar to the .txt file found in this repo will be generated
